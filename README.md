# CRiSTiK.github.io
This website is done with a very simple html and css. Since I already have my CV done with LaTeX,
I've decided to keep it's letter-like aesthetic.

## How to use it
Just go to https://cristik24.github.io,  Enjoy the great music by Listz!

## Target audience

This website is for people who want to know more about me, my projects, my skills and my CV. It's not as
profesionally done as my CV on Overleaf, but it's quite decent.

## Information architecture

The website is a one page website.

## Visual design

The website is very simple, with a "noisy" background color I found in the internet. The text is black,
the font is Times New Roman.
