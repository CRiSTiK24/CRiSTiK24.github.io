            <p>
                I'm a student of Computer Science at Universitat de Girona.
                Currently, I'm studying the 3rd year of the degree.
                Feel free to hit me up with opportunities all around Europe.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Currently balancing the beginning of my "Google Developer Student Club",
                while studying for B2 french and CS degree while also learning Piano and MMA.
                Somehow I keep searching for more things.
                Hopefully I'll prove my friends wrong, by not going insane at the end of the year,
                with this new "doing things"-mania phase of my life!
            </p>

                <h4>Google and LibreCAD selected my project "LibreCAD3 automatic releases",
                    which was based on building a CI/CD infrastructure from the ground up.
                    This year they selected 1209 out of 5155 projects.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wrote automation scripts for Windows and Linux that
                        reduced new user's install time of LC3 from a week to an hour</li>
                    <li>Contained LC3 in NSIS, AppImage and Snap installers as a way to have
                        it easily installable on Windows and Linux via using CPack, snapcraft, linuxdeploy
                        and linuxdeployqt</li>
                    <li>Modified CMake and C++ code with Qt for the purpose of the application being able to be
                        installed anywhere on the computer by using Qt functions to get the path on execution
                        and removing all the hardcoded paths to the resources</li>
                    <li>Created GitHub Actions yaml scripts in order to have the LC3 built in Github
                        by user trigger or push to the repository via adapting my previous Windows and
                        Linux install scripts</li>

                    <li>Designed a custom animal system so that users could create

                    <li>Developed a pathfinding algorithm so animals could hunt,

                    <li>Introduced a stamina system to simulate time and concurrency
                        via a stamina system of each animal group</li>
                    <li>Used algebra concepts to add population growth and
